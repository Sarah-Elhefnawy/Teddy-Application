# Teddy-Application
**Developing Mobile Application for Kids "teddy"**

I led the development of the Backend (ASP.NET Core Web API) for a Mobile Application called "teddy", dedicated to integrating educational concepts into engaging game-like activities. 

### The backend was focused on the login and Signup:
- The Login and Signup pages are designed for parents to access the application on behalf 
of their children. These pages provide a secure and personalized experience for parents by 
allowing them to create individual accounts so that they can track their child's progress, 
customize settings, and ensure a safe and age-appropriate learning environment. Parents can 
either sign in with their existing credentials or create a new account to gain access to the 
application's features
